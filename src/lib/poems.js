  my translation of Horace's <em>Carmina</em> (Odes) 1.14

  <em>O thankless ship, the morning tide takes you back to sea.
  O where do you go? Come home to port.
  See not how your sides 
  are stripped bare of oars,

  how the swift southerly wind splits open your mast,
  how your sailyard groans by the keel,
  and without lash or rigging dares not harden
  ‘gainst the ruling waters?

  Your canvased sails hang rent and low;
  no gods, for want of voice, press its malady.
  And though you are daughter of Pontic trees,
  of noble woodland air,

  boasting name and lineage – madly blind –
  lo! can painted timbers quell a seaman's fear?
  Beware the wind that
  makes you its mock and jeer!

  Your stature late made sick this heart of mine,
  and still I love you thoroughly:
  O shun the sea, which thickly pours 
  its shining entrails through the Cyclades.

  my translation of Horace's <em>Carmina</em> (Odes) 1.22

  <em>Dear my Fuscus,

  He who has lived a full life 
  has no need for Maurian spear, nor bow, 
  nor quiver of poisoned arrows,

  whether he cross through
  sweltering Syrtes or the bitter Caucuses
  or even those forlorn places where 
  the Hydaspes sweeps.

  For a wolf, while I was singing of my Lalage
  and wandering aimlessly beyond my cares,
  fled from me, 
  though I was unarmed.

  It was a horrid monster, that which even
  fierce Daunia in her broad oaks
  could not nurture,
  nor arid Juba, land of lions.

  Put me in a faded field
  where no tree is felt by summer breeze,
  in a broad world of evil and fog
  where Jupiter looms;

  put me under the chariot of the sun
  in a land without houses:
  still will I love my Lalage,
  sweetly laughing, sweetly talking.

  my translation of Catullus 70

  <em>My woman says she would not choose Jove before me,
  not even if he himself should fly to her.
  Thus she says; but what a woman says to her arduous lover
  ought to be written in the wind and the flowing water.

  <em>At the height of my delusion
  I discovered a stain the color of burnt umber
  nested clever on the shoulder-crease
  of my two-buttoned shirt.
  I saw it clearly then, and knew it to be yours.
  So the white light came out to inspect
  and found nothing where it stained my brain.
  Off with the light then,
  for I fed the stain anew with my eyes,
  and sprayed it and rubbed it and
  let it bathe in baths of salt for weeks and change.
  Ordeal's end: out came the shirt, stains 'n all;
  I knew nothing but nonsense
  for eight days after the fact.

  Illiterate Boys, written 12/7/24

  <em>Take me to your hiding place 
  In the library of crooked shelves.
  Point for me the seasons, the lone sailor, 
  The quiet party for two, the pale-lit courtrooms;
  Tell me what lies within hand-wrought folds.
  It is your smile, the dip of your curls and tie,
  The slight of your hands between the pages —
  That! is enough literature for my twin eyes,
  And if you were to lend me your hands
  We would part the woods between your tresses,
  The hunting party at your brow,
  And upon those lips and behind the ear
  We might find the Beast we are searching for.

  In response to Victor ‘MARKA27’ Quiñonez’s <em>Cranes in the Sky</em>, written 12/3/24

  <em>It has been twenty-eight days since the weather has warmed;
  Now she is flying back home as the winds tug her on.
  Sighted from over her shoulder the crane finds a perch
  And sits on the breeze drawing circles in purplesque dawn.
  Morning cracks smiles and angles the wind to her spot,
  She dips and aligns as she ruffles her wings to alight.
  A cascade of colour (the new shades of thistles in spring)
  Follows her down to her perch by the underly stream.
  Here by the road and the river the crane finds her stance
  Atop the grey bars of that concrete which holds back the sky:
  An angel, for certain, with bundles of blue close in tow
  To coat the bland interstate roads in the feelings of gold –
  Come to the dark earth and pick out the seeds to be sown,
  Watch in the water through wheat-ears and cattails for growth,
  Know when the dry air will pick up the scent of the firs,
  The first breath of August, the parting leaves withered with cold –
  See! She will free us from weathers of stillness and sloth,
  Pinks from the rising day brought out from under her wings,
  Browns from the loam of the south found from under her tongue:
  She’s painting the hope of a new set of seasons.
